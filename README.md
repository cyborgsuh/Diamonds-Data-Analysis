# Diamonds-Data-Analysis

Welcome to the Diamonds Data Analysis project! This project aims to explore and analyze a comprehensive dataset of diamond characteristics to predict their prices using various machine learning techniques. If you're interested in data analysis, machine learning, or simply curious about what makes a diamond valuable, you're in the right place!

## Project Overview

In this project, we dive into a dataset containing information on over 53,000 diamonds, including features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, price, and dimensions (x, y, z). Our goal is to build predictive models for diamond prices and gain insights into the factors that influence them.

## Key Steps
### 1. Data Exploration

We start by importing the dataset and conducting an initial exploration. This includes:

- Data cleaning: Converting categorical features into numerical codes and dropping unnecessary columns.
- Visualization: Using boxplots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps to understand data distributions and relationships.

### 2. Feature Importance Analysis

To identify the most influential features in predicting diamond prices, we employ a Random Forest Regressor. This analysis helps us focus on the key attributes that impact diamond valuation.

### 3. Clustering

We perform KMeans clustering to group diamonds based on their characteristics. Visualizing these clusters provides insights into how different features interact to form distinct groups.

### 4. Model Building and Evaluation

We build and evaluate multiple regression models, including:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- KNeighbors Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor

Each model is assessed using cross-validation and metrics such as R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Insights and Learnings

Throughout this project, we gain valuable insights into the factors that drive diamond prices. Key learnings include:

- The importance of thorough data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- How different features influence diamond prices.
- The performance comparison of various regression models.

## Conclusion

The Diamonds Data Analysis project is a fascinating journey into the world of data science and machine learning. It demonstrates how to explore and analyze a rich dataset, build predictive models, and derive meaningful insights. Whether you're a data enthusiast, a diamond aficionado, or someone looking to enhance their machine learning skills, this project has something for you.
